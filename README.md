AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
This has many moving parts for the coding side, but it is easily used.
in the terminal run npm i, then run npm run seed and to start the server just enter node server.js in terminal and the server is on.
Insomnia is also used for this project, so you can see the tags and products being created and ran for testing.
I ran into challenges with sequelize error and getting all my test to pass. I was able to correct the error and get all my test to pass. 
I will now present to you the functioning e-commerce back-end.
I colabed with some advisers working on this project: Bobbi, Emma, Jacob and Charlie.
Their insight was key to clearing up some of the errors I experienced ie; structure setup, syntax, test not passing and grammar.
Tech used to create the back end was Mysql and Sequelize.
